Domain: National diversity of Australia, people’s origin and how they are distributed  

Why:
-	This project showcases interesting data, especially since Australia is a nation built by immigrants. After seeing recent protests against immigration
-	I wanted to highlight that many Australians themselves have immigrant origins.
-	As an international student from Japan, I was also interested in understanding how many people with similar experiences reside in Australia.
  
Who:
The visualisation focuses on both Australians born in the country and those who have migrated from elsewhere, aiming to show how people move to Australia relative to their nationalities. It also encourages viewers to recognise Australia as one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world.

What:
Data source/author and its relevance: 
-	Australia population based on the country of birth: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/australias-population-country-birth/latest-release  
-	Population Increase: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/overseas-migration/latest-release 
-	Citizenship: https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/research-and-statistics/statistics/citizenship-statistics 
-	Visa type: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/overseas-migration/latest-release
  
Creation Process
-	List it out all information that I want to present
-	Brainstorm the design ideas for those information and dataset with 5 design sheets
-	Design a few layouts
-	Start implementing the chosen layout on tableau
-	Modify some layouts if not possible on html/Pure.css
-	Improve the design with the critique provided in the class

How:
The dashboard uses a range of visualisations to tell the story of Australia’s population diversity and migration trends. The proportional symbol map highlights the top countries of birth, limited to 20 to avoid overcrowding and maintain readability. The line chart makes it easier to track changes over time, focusing on the top five countries for clarity. Its legend also allows users to filter the map above interactively. The pie chart effectively shows the proportion of each group, using consistent colours with the line chart for visual coherence. It includes Australia to represent overall population diversity and allows users to select a country to highlight its share. The area chart shows the magnitude of population change over the years, with legend-based filtering for flexibility. The choropleth map uses normalised data to fairly represent population differences across states. The stacked bar chart enables easy comparison of visa type proportions each year, using a distinct colour palette to differentiate it from previous visuals. The bar chart compares differences among the top five categories to keep the information focused and uncluttered. Lastly, a script typeface was chosen to engage viewers and convey emotion, reflecting the human aspect behind migration stories.
