        <p>Australia is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. Its population of over 26 million
          includes people from more than 200 countries, speaking hundreds of languages and practicing many different
          religions. This diversity is reflected in Australia's food, traditions, and way of life.</p>
        <p>From the First Nations peoples to migrants who have made Australia their home, each group contributes to a
          vibrant, inclusive society that values respect, equality, and a shared sense of belonging.</p>

        <p>This chart shows the <b>top 20 countries</b> of birth for people living in Australia, excluding those born in
          Australia itself. The three largest groups come from <b>England</b>, <b>India</b>, and <b>New Zealand</b>, reflecting both
          historical ties and modern migration trends. Over time, there has been a clear shift, with more people from
          Asian countries choosing to make Australia their home, highlighting the country's growing connections with the
          Asia-Pacific region. The significant number of people from India also reflects Australia's evolving migration
          patterns and cultural links, showing how historical influences and modern opportunities continue to shape
          Australia's diverse population. </p>

        <h3>Overall Proportion of Birthplace (2024)</h3>
        <p style="padding-right: 40px;">This pie chart shows where people living in Australia were born. It clearly
          highlights that almost half of
          Australia's population was born overseas, showing just how diverse the country has become. The wide range of
          countries represented demonstrates Australia's multicultural nature and how migration has shaped its
          population over time. The large proportion labeled “Other” also indicates that people are coming from many
          different parts of the world, not just a few major countries.</p>

        <h3>Population Over Time</h3>
        <p>There is a steady increase in both Australia-born and overseas-born populations over time. It
          tells the story of a country that continues to grow not only through migration but also through local birth
          rates. The upward trend suggests that many people who migrate to Australia choose to settle permanently, build
          their lives, and raise families here. This highlights Australia's strong appeal as a place to live and the
          sense of stability and opportunity it offers to both newcomers and long-term residents.</p>

        <h2>Where did we go?</h2>
        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>The map highlights the number of overseas migrants across Australian states, adjusted to account for each
            state's population size. This normalisation allows for a fair comparison by showing the proportion of
            migrants rather than just the raw numbers. From the visualisation, it is evident that Victoria, New South
            Wales, and Western Australia stand out as the states with the highest levels of overseas migration relative
            to their populations. </p>

          <p>This pattern likely reflects the strong economic growth, diverse job markets, and world-class education
            systems in these regions, which attract international students and skilled workers alike. Additionally,
            these states are home to major urban centres such as <b>Melbourne</b>, <b>Sydney</b>, and <b>Perth</b>, offering vibrant
            lifestyles and cultural diversity that make them appealing destinations for migrants seeking new
            opportunities in Australia.</p>

        <h2>From Arrival to Citizenship</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p>For most years, the number of people arriving in Australia on temporary visas—such as student, working
          holiday, and business visas—has been significantly higher than the number of arrivals with permanent
          residency or Australian citizenship. However, in 2020, this trend reversed. Due to COVID-19 travel
          restrictions and border closures, the number of Australian citizens returning home exceeded the number of
          temporary visa holders entering the country, as international travel and visa programs were largely
          suspended.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div id="barchart" class="vis-container"></div>
        <p>Many people from overseas choose to become Australian citizens for various benefits, such as greater
          stability, rights, and opportunities. In particular, citizens from <b>New Zealand</b> often make up a large portion
          of new citizenships, as the process is generally easier for them compared to other nationalities.
          Additionally, the greatest number of people in the “Other” category highlights Australia's increasing cultural
          diversity, reflecting the wide range of nationalities choosing to call Australia home.</p>
